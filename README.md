# Geometry bracelet or ring #1

OpenSCAD project that creates various customizable bracelet or ring models. You can play with a lot of parameters to archive the desired look of your bracelet (see picture).

There are also ready-made STL files for two bracelets and one ring, both with 8 segments, 3 directional changes and 20 degrees of twist for each directional change.

Check it out on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4150252) with [online customizer](https://www.thingiverse.com/apps/customizer/run?thing_id=4150252) and on [PrusaPrinters](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/20858-geometry-bracelet-ring)!

## Print settings

Print with some (semi)transparent PETG filament with following settings:

* without infill
* 2 perimeters
* 5 top and bottom solid layers

## Filament tips

I have tested following filaments, both bracelets and rings made from them look great and they are also __UV reactive__ (glowing in UV light)!

* [Prusament PETG Neon Green](https://amzn.to/2S9jRz5)
* [Prusament PLA Mr. Pink](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/prusament/718-prusament-pla-ms-pink-1kg.html)

There are other UV reactive filaments listed on Amazon, some tips (not tested):

* [MG Chemicals Fluorescent Red / Hot Pink PLA](https://amzn.to/2Uy1OEe)
* [Gizmo Dorks Fluorescent Yellow PLA](https://amzn.to/39fn1Hl)
* [Gizmo Dorks Fluorescent Blue PLA](https://amzn.to/2OA5rWn)

## Requirements

If you want to play with the design in OpenSCAD or you want to modify the code and contribute, you will need:

* [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/) version 2019.05 or later
* [Polyround library](https://github.com/Irev-Dev/Round-Anything)

For Thingiverse online customizer the SCAD file is slightly modified - the library file is included directly in the main file (no use statement) and let statements are expanded, because Thingiverse probably uses older version of OpenSCAD engine.
